What does fast-forward in Git mean?
when you merge something that can be followed by the first commit's history, git will move the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together 

Why should you have different branches?
Each team member has different works so that they have different version from the original code. 
Thus, we need different branches to ensure that different version will not affect the original code

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
only 1
